                <h3>An estimated 57 million people are living with type 1 diabetes. A large proportion of these people with diabetes live in places with inadequate healthcare. This means that there are likely hundreds of thousands of people (or more) facing death due to lack of insulin.</h3>
                <p>Prices for insulin and diabetes management are completely unaffordable to many people living with the condition. For example, our friend Nasiru in Nigeria must pay more than $100USD per month on his diabetes supplies, but the average monthly salary for a middle-class Nigerian is only $480USD, which means that if he were employed, nearly 25% of his income would be spent on diabetes supplies. In other places supplies can cost as much as 75% of a family’s income.</p>

                <p>People around the world with type 1 diabetes also face other obstacles like an inability to keep insulin cool, lack of test strips and other diabetes supplies, and lack of education about diabetes. Without health insurance (or even with a health insurance plan) a person in the United States or Canada can be forced to pay thousands of dollars per month for their diabetes supplies and therefore may not be able to afford them at all. The injustice of all of this is outrageous.</p>
                <p>These issues are global in scale and they effect every single one of us, whether we live with diabetes, know someone with diabetes, or care about human rights. It is vital that we raise our voices with those at the heart of this issue to support our brothers and sisters with diabetes and demand an end to this injustice.</p>

                <h3>What can be done?</h3>
                <p>There has been an incredible impact on decreasing HIV/Aids, so why aren’t we seeing the same response in Non-Communicable diseases like diabetes? There are various answers to those questions, but a lot of it comes down to lack of awareness and education. For example, many people do not understand the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When you don’t understand something you tend to forget or ignore it. People simply don’t realize that a person will die without enough insulin.</p>
                <p>T1International is one of several organisations trying to raise this much-needed awareness. We hope to bring the community together, inspiring action to improve the situation of those living with type 1 diabetes who are not as lucky as others. You can support the cause right away by making a donation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We remain people-focused by sharing the voices of those living with type 1 diabetes around the world to raise awareness of the issues</li>
                    <li>We serve as a knowledge hub to give a clear picture of the issues, offer resources, and signpost people and organisations to further information that can support them</li>
                    <li>We dig deep into the problems of lack of access to diabetes supplies, care and treatment to push for and collect the best data and statistics around these issues to ensure we are tackling the problems in the best way and reaching the most underserved populations</li>
                    <li>We campaign for systemic change and support existing campaigns so that our vision becomes a reality</li>
